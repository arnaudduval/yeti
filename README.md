# YETI : Yet another IGA code
YETI is a library offering an implementation of IsoGeometric Analysis based on NURBS and B-Splines. It is published under the GNU Lesser General Public Licence and comes in the form of a Python library allowing the user to enter the input data of a NURBS parametrization (as a text file inspired from Abaqus  input files syntax). Stiffness and mass matrices and right hand side vector are computed to form linear systems for solving mechanical or thermal problems. Solid or Kirchhoff-Love shell elements are available.
