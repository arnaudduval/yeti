Input files reference
*********************

A basic input dataset in yeti is composed of a :file:`*.inp` file and a :file:`*.NB` (both files have the same base name).
:file:`*.inp` file is greatly inspired from Abaqus input files and :file:`*.NB` contains specific data for NURBS/B-Spline representation.
